This repository contains the githookcontroller, a general tool to construct git hooks for git\-Hub based projects without a central contral server.

\subsection*{Using githookcontroller in your repo\-:}

\subsubsection*{Setup\-:}

The easiest way to implement the githookcontroller to your repo is to add setup script as shown in the setup.\-sh.\-example file and run it from the root directory of your repo. \subsubsection*{Adjusting the hooks}

Githookcontroller ships with some exampe hook implementations, which you may want to adjust. The standard way to use the githookcontroller is to create a Git\-Hook\-Controller class object within a python hook script, parse hook infos if necessary and call member functions of the controller (e.\-g. update doxygen) to perform hook actions as needed.

\subsubsection*{Currently implemented features\-:}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Parse output from pre-\/commit hooks.
\item Parse which files are changed in a commit.
\item Several easy to use controller class properties\-: current\-\_\-branch, tracked remote\-\_\-branches, local and remote root directory name, remote url.
\item Function to checkout different branches in local repo.
\item Create branch specific doxygen documentation on every commit (see hooks/pre-\/commit). Doxygen documentation without warnig can be enfoced based on repo root and branch name.
\item Add doxygen documentation for given branches to gh-\/pages branch (see hooks/pre-\/push).
